### Key Insights
- **Context Switching:** Jumping between reading the bug report, finding the relevant code, running tests, and writing the fix is time-consuming.
    - **Repetitive Work:** Alex spends a lot of time writing boilerplate code, documentation, and unit tests. It's necessary but not creatively fulfilling.
    - **Codebase Archeology:** When tackling a bug in an unfamiliar part of the codebase, it can take an hour just to understand the logic and data flow.
    - **Privacy Concerns:** Alex is forbidden by company policy from pasting proprietary code into public AI chat interfaces for security reasons.
    - **Goal:** Alex wants to spend more time on complex architectural problems and less time on routine coding and bug-fixing. They want an assistant that works *with* them in their existing environment.
