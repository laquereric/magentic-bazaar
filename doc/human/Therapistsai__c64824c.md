A psychotherapist who uses AI to transcribe sessions so they can refresh their memory about an exact phrase while they’re making notes is a centaur. A psychotherapist who monitors 20 chat sessions with LLM “therapists” in order to intervene if the LLM starts telling patients to kill themselves is a “reverse centaur.” This situation makes it impossible for them to truly help “their” patients; they are an “accountability sink,” installed to absorb the blame when a patient is harmed by the AI.
