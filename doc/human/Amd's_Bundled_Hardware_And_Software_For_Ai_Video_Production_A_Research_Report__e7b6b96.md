# AMD's Bundled Hardware and Software for AI Video Production: A Research Report

**Date:** Jan 30, 2026
**Author:** Manus AI

## Executive Summary

This report details AMD's strategic initiatives in the AI-accelerated video production market. The core of AMD's strategy is the **AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™ AI Bundle**, a comprehensive, one-click installer that simplifies the setup of a local AI development and creation environment. Released on January 21, 2026, this bundle provides a suite of pre-configured AI applications, including PyTorch, ComfyUI, and others, designed to run on specific AMD Radeon™ graphics cards and Ryzen™ AI processors [1][5].

Beyond its own software bundle, AMD has forged deep engineering collaborations with key Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to optimize their applications for AMD hardware. This research highlights significant performance enhancements in leading video editing software such as **Blackmagic Design's DaVinci Resolve** and **Topaz Labs' Video AI**. For instance, AI features in DaVinci Resolve 18.6 see performance boosts of up to 4x on AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX GPUs [3]. Similarly, Topaz Video AI's new diffusion-based enhancement models achieve up to a 3.3x performance improvement on AMD platforms [4].

By combining powerful local hardware with an accessible software ecosystem, AMD is positioning itself as a compelling alternative to cloud-based AI solutions, offering creators enhanced performance, reduced latency, and greater cost efficiency for AI-driven video production workflows.

## 1. The AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™ AI Bundle

Introduced with the Adrenalin Edition™ 26.1.1 driver, the AI Bundle is an optional, ~35GB package that automates the installation of essential AI tools. This initiative removes the significant technical barriers traditionally associated with setting up a local AI environment, such as managing dependencies and configurations [1][5].

### 1.1. Included Software

The bundle includes a curated selection of applications relevant to a range of AI workflows, from model development to generative content creation. For video production, the inclusion of PyTorch and ComfyUI is particularly noteworthy.

| Application | Description | Relevance to AI Video Production |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PyTorch on Windows** | A leading machine learning framework for building and training AI models. The bundle includes Python 3.12 and Visual Studio Code. | Enables developers to create custom AI models for tasks like video analysis, object tracking, or unique visual effects. |
| **ComfyUI** | A node-based graphical user interface for creating and executing advanced AI image generation workflows. | Allows creators to design and run complex generative AI pipelines for creating video assets, style transfers, or visual effects. |
| **Ollama** | A tool for running large language models (LLMs) locally. | Useful for AI-driven scriptwriting, generating video descriptions, or automating text-based editing tasks. |
| **LM Studio** | A desktop application for discovering, downloading, and running local LLMs. | Provides an alternative user-friendly interface for leveraging LLMs in the video production workflow. |
| **Amuse** | An AMD-optimized text-to-image generation application. | Facilitates the quick creation of high-quality still images and concept art that can be used in video projects. |

### 1.2. Hardware Requirements

The AI Bundle is specifically designed to leverage the capabilities of AMD's latest hardware architectures.

| Component | Supported Series |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AMD Radeon Graphics** | Radeon™ RX 9000 Series (All Models) <br> Radeon™ RX 7000 Series (RX 7700 and higher) |
| **AMD Ryzen Processors** | Ryzen™ AI Max Series <br> Ryzen™ AI 400 Series <br> Ryzen™ AI 300 Series |

*Table 2: Hardware requirements for the AMD AI Bundle. [5]*

## 2. AI-Acceleration in Professional Video Software

AMD's strategy extends beyond its own bundle to deep partnerships with ISVs, ensuring that professional video editing applications are highly optimized for its hardware.

### 2.1. Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve

AMD and Blackmagic Design have collaborated to optimize the machine learning pipeline in DaVinci Resolve 18.6. By migrating key features to the Microsoft DirectML API, which is accelerated by AMD's drivers, the software achieves significant performance gains on Radeon™ hardware [3].

| AI Feature | Performance Boost (on RX 7900 XTX) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Magic Mask** | Over 4x faster | Uses the DaVinci Neural Engine to automatically detect and track people or objects for targeted color grading or effects. |
| **Speed Warp** | 3x better performance | Generates new frames to create exceptionally smooth slow-motion or speed-ramping effects. |
| **Super Scale** | Over 1.5x more performance | An advanced upscaling algorithm that creates new pixels to increase image resolution while preserving detail. |

*Table 3: Key AI feature performance improvements in DaVinci Resolve 18.6 on AMD hardware. [3]*

In total, 19 distinct AI features within DaVinci Resolve 18.6 are now GPU-accelerated on AMD hardware, including tools for audio transcription, voice isolation, smart reframing, and scene cut detection [3].

### 2.2. Topaz Labs Video AI

Topaz Labs, a leader in AI-powered image and video enhancement, has partnered with AMD to optimize its software. A key outcome is the acceleration of **Project Starlight**, the first diffusion-based AI model for video enhancement, which transforms low-resolution or degraded footage into high-definition quality with full temporal consistency [4].

Through the use of AMD's Optimizer toolchains and the Wave-MMA (Wave Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate) AI hardware accelerators in RDNA™ 3 and newer architectures, Topaz Video AI achieves:

> ...up to 3.3x performance improvement and significant memory reduction vs. the base model when running on AMD platforms. [4]

This optimization enables real-time, local execution of generative AI video enhancement models that were previously too resource-intensive for consumer-grade hardware.

### 2.3. Adobe Creative Cloud

AMD also collaborates with Adobe to ensure AI features within its creative suite are optimized for Radeon™ graphics. This includes AI-powered tools in **Adobe Premiere Pro** such as text-based editing, auto reframe, and color match, as well as generative AI features within **Adobe Photoshop** [2].

## 3. Conclusion

AMD is executing a multi-faceted strategy to capture the growing market for AI-accelerated video production. The **AMD AI Bundle** provides an accessible on-ramp for developers and creators to begin working with local AI, while deep partnerships with software leaders like **Blackmagic Design** and **Topaz Labs** ensure that professional-grade tools are highly optimized for AMD's hardware.

This combination of a simplified software ecosystem, powerful dedicated AI hardware (RDNA™ 3/4, Ryzen™ AI), and strong industry partnerships creates a robust platform for the next generation of video production workflows. By enabling complex AI tasks to run efficiently on local machines, AMD offers a compelling value proposition of enhanced performance, lower costs, and increased creative freedom.
